I developed a stopwatch project that not only accurately tracks time but also includes lap time functionality, allowing users to record and review split times during timing intervals. The project involved designing and implementing a user-friendly interface to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch, as well as capture lap times with precision. Each lap time is displayed in real-time, providing users with immediate feedback on their performance.

During my internship at prodigy infotech,I had the opportunity to further enhance my programming skills by working on similar time-sensitive projects. The experience gained during my internship helped me incorporate industry best practices into my stopwatch project, ensuring its efficiency and reliability. Overall, this project not only showcases my technical abilities but also highlights my capacity to develop practical solutions for real-world applications.
